# Overview of the Project


Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. Britta needed my help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I refactored the code from the ETL module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
